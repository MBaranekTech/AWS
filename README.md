# Deploying Node.js on AWS EC2
Step 1: Create EC2 instance - I am using Ubuntu Free Tier <>
Step 2: In security section - leave all settings and add PORT 3000 from your IP address <br>
Step 3: Create KEY pair and download - .PEM or .PPK format <br>
Step 4: Launch instance <br>
Step 5: Wait for turning on instance and connect with your generated keypair <br>
Step 6: Every instance has own public IP - use that for connection for example from Putty - Windows

Step 7: Setup EC2 Instance - Download and install updates
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
Step 8: Install Node.js
```
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
Step 9: Upload your node.JS file for run to Ubuntu EC2 Instance
```
You can use tool: WinSCP - Windows
On Mac, Linux rsync - rsync -avz /path/to/local/file username@remote_host:/path/to/remote/destination/
-a: Archive mode (preserves permissions, timestamps, etc.)
-v: Verbose output (optional but helpful)
-z: Compress file during transfer (optional, good for large files)
/path/to/local/file: Path to the file you're uploading
```
Step 10: Run in terminal 
```
node example.js
```

Step 10: Set your service like System Service - for running on background 
```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service

[Unit]
Description=Simple Node.js Servioce
After=network.target multi-user.target

[Service]
User=ubuntu
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/JS
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /home/ubuntu/JS/example.js
Restart=on-failure
Environment=NODE_ENV=production
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=myapp

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Step 11: Reload systemd and start your service
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable myapp.service
sudo systemctl start myapp.service
sudo systemctl status myapp.service
```
If your Node.js app need DB you can install it very easy
```
sudo apt install mysql-server
sudo systemctl start mysql
sudo systemctl enable mysql
sudo mysql -u root

CREATE DATABASE my_app;
CREATE USER 'my_app_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'MyFirstPass123!';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON my_app.* TO 'my_app_user'@'localhost';
```
